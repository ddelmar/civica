		  	<h1>The Big Picture</h1>
		  	<p>We're losing our edge in tech innovation. <b>We need all hands on deck. </b>
		  </p>
		  <p>(And that means raising more hands.)

		  </article>

		<article>
			<h1>Taking it Personally</h1>
			<p>Resilient Coders is a lecture-free model, during which students are expected to teach themselves to code. They have help from working professionals, but the onus to create is on the student. We make technology relevant to them, by presenting it as (1) a  medium for self-expression, and (2) an opportunity of gainful employment.</p>
		</article>
     
	 <article>
		 <h1>The Three-Tiered Model</h1>
		 <p>Partnership&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bootcamp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment</p>
		 
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h1>1. Partnership</h1>
			<p>A collaboration with an existing community-based organization, usually 8 weeks long. Students are expected to finish a cohort with a simple website, and a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. The objective for this class is to spark interest among the youth, and hopefully hook the students.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h1>2. Bootcamp</h1>
			<p>Four-week summer program, during which students hone their skills. Students are sourced from earlier partnership programs. Key learning principles run the gamut from technical and business skills, to professional development. They will learn how to collaborate with each other, how to interface with a client, and how to run a business. Second- and third-year students will be employed as mentors to the younger students, thus helping us scale.</p>
				
		</article>
		<article>
			<h1>3. Employment</h1>
			<p>We aim to help Boston reach <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/08/17/walsh-falling-short-ambitious-goal-for-teen-jobs/WDbVb6QtsmLJ5zAzHf6C3I/story.html" target="_blank">its goals for youth employment.</a> When our students are ready, we will launch "Resilient Lab," an actual web design and development studio, run by Resilient staff. We will have real clients. And the students, under staff guidance and supervision, will work on these projects. They will be paid for their work, on a skill-based scale.</p>
				
		</article>	
		
		<article>
			<h1>Three-Tiered Objectives</h1>
			<p>We want to pull kids off the street. We want to give them the skills necessary to compete in the tech economy. And we want to give them real, professional experience.</p>
				
		</article>	
		<article>
			<h1>We've made some friends</h1>
			<p>
				<b>In government:</b> The Boston Police Department, The Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, and the Department of Youth Services. <b>In Youth Development:</b>Trinity Boston Foundation, Girls Who Code, Possible Project, Press Pass TV, and the Justice Resource Institute. <b>In Tech Education:</b> The Startup Institute and Launch Academy. 
			</p>
				
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h1>Early Successes, 5 months in</h1>
			<p>
				We've been selected to join the new cohort of <a href="http://tugg.org" target="_blank">TUGG,</a> and we won their "Tech Gives Back" event, bringing home <b>$50,000 in funding.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				We were selected for <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2014/06/26/startup-institutes-24-hour-ideahack-to-bolster-the-next-generation-of-resilient-coders/" target="_blank">the Startup Institute's IdeaHack.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				And we've been awarded two grants from the Boston Police Department.</p>
				
		</article>
		
		
		<article>
			<h1>But what do the students think?</h1>
			<p>We polled our students anonymously. Students who <i>did not choose</i> to take this class.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h1></h1>
			<p>
				<span class="red">61%</span> of students want to keep coding.<br/>
				<span class="red">85%</span> are more interested in technology now than they were before Resilient.
			</p>
			<p>
				And what was their favorite thing about Resilient Coders?</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<h1></h1>
			<p>
				"The feeling you get after doing something on your own!!! Success!!!"
				
			</p>
			<p>
				"There's a lot of hands on experience with coding and that was really cool and fun. Resilient Coders is amazing and funnest thing I've ever done."
			</p>
			<p>
				"My favorite thing about this class is the meaning behind Resilient Coders."
			</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h1></h1>
			<p>
				"Learning that coding is something I can do."
			</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h1>Sustainability</h1>
			<p>Once our students have the aptitude necessary to begin charging for their work, we intend to unlock real-world employment opportunities for them by launching Resilient Lab, a web design/development studio. We expect Resilient Lab to be largely self-sufficient.</p>
			<p>But we need to get there first.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h1>Maximizing our Impact</h1>
			
			<p>
We've received a grant from the Police Department for $24,500, to be used to teach behind bars. We've also won TUGG's Tech Gives Back event, and took home a $50,000 donation, which will help us start teaching at Boston Public Schools. We're off to a good start, but we have plans to do more. </p>

				<b>With every donation of $600, we can run a Popup cohort.</b> This means a class of students will build their own simple websites. With a gift of $20,000 we will be able to run our summer program, in which students will gain valuable real-world professional skills, and hone their technical aptitude.</b>

			<h1>Thank You</h1>
			<p>
Resilient Coders is part of a movement. And a movement takes an engaged community. So thank you for your time and interest.
