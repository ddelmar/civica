		<h2>The Program</h2>

Resilient Coders <span class="highlight">is brand new.</span> But we're off to a running start. We gave our first class behind bars in May of this year, and have since been making friends. We're immensely grateful for the enthusiastic early support (financial or otherwise) of our partners in the Boston Police Department, Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, Trinity Boston Foundation, Department of Youth Services, and others in Boston's City Hall. We've also been lucky enough to have received plenty of help from our friends at Startup Institute Boston.
</p><p>

We like to think of the program as being <span class="highlight">adaptive</span> to the needs of our partners. In a corrections facility, the program is eight weeks long, for an hour a week. Whereas our summer program is four weeks long, twice a week, and based out of community centers. This photo was taken at one such center, with our partner, Trinity's Education for Excellence Program (TEEP). 
</p><p>
When we begin working with schools, the program will be longer, and the curriculum will be more robust. And by this time next year, we hope to have achieved the scale necessary to transition to a four-part model: 
</p><p>
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; School year 1: After school studies<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer 1: Tech bootcamp<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; School year 2: Student mentors at after school studies<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer 2: Internship placement, or mentoring at Tech bootcamp</p><p>

Currently, our students learn the basic tenets of HTML and CSS. They're coached along by a web professional as they learn by doing. There's a community of web developers working today who have learned what they know by tinkering; by building, breaking, problem solving, and building anew. We believe this to be the best way to learn. This is the spirit of Resilient Coders.
