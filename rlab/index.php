		<h2>The Program</h2>
		<p>Resilient Lab is a free, volunteer-based program focused on making web technology more available to kids who might not otherwise be exposed to it. They'll spend eight weeks building their own websites, exploring web development as a means of self-expression.

		<h2>Why it matters</h2>
		<p>
<b>It's good for the student</b><br />
A student could have an innate gift for web development, and just never have an opportunity to explore it. He may not have the right role model, or live in a community that values it. If we were to just introduce the basics to these kids, we might awaken the curiosity of one such student, and begin to bridge the opportunity gap in that one case.
<br /><br />
<b>The tech world needs these kids</b><br />
While 7% of Americans can't find work, the tech industry still struggles to find talent. There simply aren't enough people in the workforce to satisfy a market hungry for certain skill sets. The local tech community stands to benefit from an investment in programs that expand the talent pool, and open the doors to young people from communities traditionally underrepresented in technology.
<br /><br />
<b>Our communities benefit from the students' development of a lucrative skill</b>
<br />The best way to break the generational cycle of poverty is to get kids interested in developing a reliable and lucrative skill.
