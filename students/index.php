		<h2>Hacking the opportunity gap</h2>
		<div class="product">
			<p>
				Resilient Coders is a free, volunteer-based program focused on making web technology more available to kids who might not otherwise be exposed to it. Each student builds his or her own website, coached along by a web professional.
			</p>
				<p>
		<b>It's good for the student</b><br />
		A student could have an innate gift for web development, and just never have an opportunity to explore it. He may not have the right role model, or live in a community that values it. If we were to just introduce the basics to these kids, we might awaken the curiosity of one such student, and begin to bridge the opportunity gap in that one case.
		<br /><br />
		<b>The tech world needs these kids</b><br />
		While 7% of Americans can't find work, the tech industry still struggles to find talent. There simply aren't enough people in the workforce to satisfy a market hungry for certain skill sets. The local tech community stands to benefit from an investment in programs that expand the talent pool, and open the doors to young people from communities traditionally underrepresented in technology.
