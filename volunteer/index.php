			<h3>The Cohorts</h3>
			<ol>
<li><b>The Popup.</b> This is Resilient Coders Lite, so to speak. It's eight hours long, spread out over four weeks. They take place at a few schools or community centers around town, after school. This works as a feeder program for our summer program. The students spend their eight hours teaching themselves HTML and CSS as they build out their own websites.
</li>
<li><b>The School Year.</b> This cohort lasts a full school year, at a school. We're running our first one this year, starting in November. It's also one to two hours a week, around 3pm.
</li>
<li><b>Summer tech bootcamp.</b> This is 4 weeks over the summer, and "full-time," at nine to three. It's a little bit more freeform in that we can find a schedule that works best for you to come in and meet with your students while they work. 
</li>
</ol>

	However it is you choose to help, email me at <a href="mailto:david@resilientcoders.org">david@resilientcoders.org</a> and I will dispense one hand-stinging high five, like Erik's. The kind that makes people look to make sure everyone's okay.
